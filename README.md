# **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create new data tables from our existing ERP tables and find the number of retiring employees, and employyes eligible for a mentorship program. This analysis will help us to plan how many recruitments we will need at the company, and how much training needs to be done to prepare the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

1. We learned that 72,458 employees are retiring soon 
2. 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program 

## Summary
From our findings, 72,458 roles will need to be filled as these employees are retiring soon. This is a huge amount, while the employees that are eligible to be mentored is 1,529. In order to reduce the effects of the "silver tsunami", we should start looking into recruting bright engineers, since that is the department which will have the most turnover.
